 At the same time, in addition to my research on perception, I was also deeply immersed in an
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 in-depth study of the success literature published in the United States since 1776. I was reading
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 or scanning literally hundreds of books, articles, and essays in fields such as self-improvement,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 popular psychology, and self-help. At my fingertips was the sum and substance of what a free
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 and democratic people considered to be the keys to successful living.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 As my study took me back through 200 years of writing about success, I noticed a startling
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 pattern emerging in the content of the literature. Because of our own pain, and because of similar
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 pain I had seen in the lives and relationships of many people I had worked with through the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 years, I began to feel more and more that much of the success literature of the past 50 years was
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 superficial. It was filled with social image consciousness, techniques and quick fixes\'97with
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 social Band-Aids and aspirin that addressed acute problems and sometimes even appeared to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 solve them temporarily, but left the underlying chronic problems untouched to fester and
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 resurface time and again.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 In stark contrast, almost all the literature in the first 150 years or so focused on what could be
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 called the Character Ethic as the foundation of success\'97things like integrity, humility, fidelity,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Benjamin Franklin\'92s autobiography is representative of that literature. It is, basically, the story of
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 one man\'92s effort to integrate certain principles and habits deep within his nature.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 The Character Ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 principles into their basic character.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 But shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the Character Ethic to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 what we might call the Personality Ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 human interaction. This Personality Ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 relations techniques, and the other was positive mental attitude (PMA). Some of this philosophy
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 was expressed in inspiring and sometimes valid maxims sucaltitude,\'94 \'93Smiling wins more friends than frowning,\'94 and \'93Whatever the mind of man can
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 conceive and believe it can achieve.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Other parts of the personality approach were clearly manipulative, even deceptive,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 encouraging people to use techniques to get other people to like them, or to fake interest in the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 hobbies of others to get out of them what they wanted, or to use the \'93power look,\'94 or to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 intimidate their way through life.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Some of this literature acknowledged character as an ingredient of success, but tended to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 compartmentalize it rather than recognize it as foundational and catalytic. Reference to the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Character Ethic became mostly lip service; the basic thrust was quick-fix influence techniques,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 power strategies, communication skills, and positive attitudes.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 This Personality Ethic, I began to realize, was the subconscious source of the solutions Sandra
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 and I were attempting to use with our son. As I thought more deeply about the difference
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 between the Personality and Character Ethics, I realized that Sandra and I had been getting social
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 mileage out of our children\'92s good behavior, and, in our eyes, this son simply didn\'92t measure up.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Our image of ourselves, and our role as good, caring parents, was even deeper than our image of
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 our son and perhaps influenced it. There was a lot more wrapped up in the way we were seeing
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 and handling the problem than our concern for our son\'92s welfare.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 As Sandra and I talked, we became painfully aware of the powerful influence of our own
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 character and motives and of our perception of him. We knew that social comparison motives
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 were out of harmony with our deeper values and could lead to conditional love and eventually to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 our son\'92s lessened sense of self-worth. So we determined to focus our efforts on us\'97not on our
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 techniques, but on our deepest motives and our perception of him. Instead of trying to change
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 him, we tried to stand apart\'97to separate us from him\'97and to sense his identity, individuality,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 separateness, and worth.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Through deep thought and the exercise of faith and prayer, we began to see our son in terms
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 of his own uniqueness. We saw within him layers and layers of potential that would be realized
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 at his own pace and speed. We decided to relax and get out of his way and let his own
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 personality emerge. We saw our natural role as being to affirm, enjoy, and value him. We also
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 conscientiously worked on our motives and cultivated internal sources of security so that our
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 own feelings of worth were not dependent on our children\'92s \'93acceptable\'94 behavior.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 As we loosened up our old perception of our son and developed value-based motives, new
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 feelings began to emerge. We found ourselves enjoying him instead of comparing or judging
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 him. We stopped trying to clone him in our own image or measure him against social
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 expectations. We stopped trying to kindly, positively manipulate him into an acceptable social
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 mold. Because we saw him as fundamentally adequate and able to cope with life, we stopped
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 protecting him against the ridicule of others.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 He had been nurtured on this protection, so he went through some withdrawal pains, which he
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 expressed and which we accepted, but did not necessarily respond to. \'93We don\'92t need to protect
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 you,\'94 was the unspoken message. \'93You\'92re fundamentally okay.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 As the weeks and months passed, he began to feel a quiet confidence and affirmed himself.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 He began to blossom, at his own pace and speed. He became outstanding as measured by
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 standard social criteria\'97academically, socially and athletically\'97at a rapid clip, far beyond the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 so-called natural developmental process. As the years passed, he was elected to several student
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 body leadership positions, developed into an all-state athlete and started bringing home straight
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 A report cards. He developed an engaging and guileless personality that has enabled him to relate
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 in nonthreatening ways to all kinds of people.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Sandra and I believe that our son\'92s \'93socially impressive\'94 accomplishments were more a
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 serendipitous expression of the feelings he had about himself than merely a response to social
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 reward. This was an amazing experience for Sandra and me, and a very instructional one in
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 dealing with our other children and in other roles as well. It brought to our awareness on a very
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 personal level the vital difference between the Personality Ethic and the Character Ethic of success. The Psalmist expressed our conviction well: \'93Search your own heart with all diligence
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 for out of it flow the issues of life.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
\

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 My experience with my son, my study of perception and my reading of the success literature
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 coalesced to create one of those \'93Aha!\'94 experiences in life when suddenly things click into place.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 I was suddenly able to see the powerful impact of the Personality Ethic and to clearly understand
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 those subtle, often consciously unidentified discrepancies between what I knew to be true\'97some
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 things I had been taught many years ago as a child and things that were deep in my own inner
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 sense of value\'97and the quick fix philosophies that surrounded me every day. I understood at a
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 deeper level why, as I had worked through the years with people from all walks of life, I had
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 found that the things I was teaching and knew to be effective were often at variance with these
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 popular voices.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 I am not suggesting that elements of the Personality Ethic\'97personality growth,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 communication skill training, and education in the field of influence strategies and positive
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 thinking\'97are not beneficial, in fact sometimes essential for success. I believe they are. But these
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 are secondary, not primary traits. Perhaps, in utilizing our human capacity to build on the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 foundation of generations before us, we have inadvertently become so focused on our own
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 building that we have forgotten the foundation that holds it up; or in reaping for so long where
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 we have not sown, perhaps we have forgotten the need to sow.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 If I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other people to do what I
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 want, to work better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other\'97while my character is
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 fundamentally flawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity\'97then, in the long run, I cannot be
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 successful. My duplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do\'97even using so-called good
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 human relations techniques\'97will be perceived as manipulative. It simply makes no difference
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 how good the rhetoric is or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 no foundation for permanent success. Only basic goodness gives life to technique.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 To focus on technique is like cramming your way through school. You sometimes get by,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 perhaps even get good grades, but if you don\'92t pay the price day in and day out, you never
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 achieve true mastery of the subjects you study or develop an educated mind.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Did you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to try to cram on a farm\'97to forget to plant
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 in the spring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to bring in the harvest? The farm is a
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 natural system. The price must be paid and the process followed. You always reap what you sow;
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 there is no shortcut.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 This principle is also true, ultimately, in human behavior, in human relationships. They, too,
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 are natural systems based on the law of the harvest. In the short run, in an artificial social system
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 such as school, you may be able to get by if you learn how to manipulate the man-made rules, to
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 \'93play the game.\'94 In most one-shot or short-lived human interactions, you can use the Personality
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Ethic to get by and to make favorable impressions through charm and skill and pretending to be
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 interested in other people\'92s hobbies. You can pick up quick, easy techniques that may work in
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 short-term situations. But secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 relationships. Eventually, if there isn\'92t deep integrity and fundamental character strength, the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 challenges of life will cause true motives to surface and human relationship failure will replace
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 short-term success.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Many people with secondary greatness\'97that is, social recognition for their talents\'97lack
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 primary greatness or goodness in their character. Sooner or later, you\'92ll see this in every longterm relationship they have, whether it is with a business associate, a spouse, a friend, or a
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 teenage child going through an identity crisis. It is character that communicates most eloquently.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 As Emerson once put it, \'93What you are shouts so loudly in my ears I cannot hear what you say.\'94
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 There are, of course, situations where people have character strength but they lack
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 communication skills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well. But the
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 effects are still secondary.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 In the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 do. We all know it. There are people we trust absolutely because we know their character.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 Whether they\'92re eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations techniques or not, we
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 trust them, and we work successfully with them.
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 In the words of William George Jordan, \'93Into the hands of every individual is given a
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 marvelous power for good or evil\'97the silent, unconscious, unseen influence of his life. This is
\f0\fs24 \

\f1\fs29\fsmilli14667 simply the constant radiation of what man really is, not what he pretends to be.\'94
\f0\fs24 \
